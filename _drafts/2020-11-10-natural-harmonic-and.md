title: "Natural, harmonic, and melodic: Motivating the minor scales"

In this post we will understand and motivate the three forms of the minor scale. There are a lot of convergent resources on this topic, and not a lot of debate, but this material was new to me. I have collected my findings here.

### Natural minor

We discussed how [perfect consonances and well-placed leading tones]({{ "" | relative_url }}{% post_url 2020-11-10-an-objective-construction %}) distinguish the major scale and (natural) minor scales among the [many possible modes of the diatonic scale]({{ "" | relative_url }}{% post_url 2020-11-9-diatonic-modes-a %}). Recall from our discussion that the minor scale sounds sad because it has more flats relative to the major scale with the same tonic note.

### Harmonic minor
