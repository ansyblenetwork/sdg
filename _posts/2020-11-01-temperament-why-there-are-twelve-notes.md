title: "Temperament: Why there are twelve notes in Western music"

The short answer: Because

$$3^{12} = 531441 \approx 524288 = 2^{19}.$$

The wise(?) answer: Because musical heterogeneity comes from _intervals_, not pitches.

The long answer:

### Consonance

The experience of sound is the detection of air waves, and different pitches correspond to different wavelengths. High pitches correspond to short wavelengths. The traditional physical explanation for consonance between two notes is that the ratio of their wavelengths is a ratio of small integers. These include

$$\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{7}.$$

Here I have chosen fractions involving 1 and primes from 2 through 7. The lower the integers, the greater the consonance. 

### Octave equivalence

In particular, the most consonant wavelength ratio of 1 to 2 corresponds to an octave interval; the notes sound "the same." The question of why such octave-separated pitches sound similar is an empirical question and doesn't have a clean answer. For instance, studies have found that chimpanzees also experience octave equivalence. On the other hand, [other studies](https://www.quantamagazine.org/perceptions-of-musical-octaves-are-learned-not-wired-in-the-brain-20191030/) have discovered isolated cultures which do not:

  Computer analyses that compared the Tsimané participants with those in the United States found that both groups generally preserved the pitch intervals between the notes played to them — for example, maintaining the difference between a middle C and middle A...

A curious difference emerged, however, in how they sang the notes back. When the notes played were very high or low, U.S. participants accurately shifted the notes into an octave within their vocal range. The Tsimané didn’t. To them, it seemingly wasn’t clear what notes in their range best corresponded to the ones they heard. Their responses didn’t seem to reflect a perception of octave structure at all.
