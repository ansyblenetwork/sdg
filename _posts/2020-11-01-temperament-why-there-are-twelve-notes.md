title: "Temperament: Why there are twelve notes in Western music"
---

The short answer: Because

$$3^{12} = 531441 \approx 524288 = 2^{19}.$$

The wise(?) answer: Because musical heterogeneity comes from _intervals_, not pitches.

The long answer:

### Consonance

The experience of sound is the detection of air waves, and different pitches correspond to different wavelengths. High pitches correspond to short wavelengths. 

The traditional physical explanation for consonance between two notes is that the ratio of their wavelengths is a ratio of small integers. These include

$$\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{7}.$$

Here I have chosen fractions involving pairs of the primes from 2 through 7. The lower the integers, the greater the supposed consonance.
