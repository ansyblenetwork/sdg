title: "Meantone temperament: Introducing the major third"
---

Recall from our [discussion of consonance]({{ absolute_url }}{% post_url 2020-11-01-the-circle-of-fifths-why-there %}) the list of small integer ratios:

$$\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{7}.$$

There, we discussed the ratios 1/2 (octave equivalence) and 1/3 (the perfect fifth). The next most consonant wavelength ratio of 1/5 essentially corresponds to a major third. As written, this interval is larger than two octaves; an actual major third corresponds to lowering the higher note of the interval by two octaves, for a 4 to 5 ratio.

The reason we do not introduce more notes is simply that there are already too many: There are 12 notes already generated by the perfect fifths alone. In particular, we may approximate

$$\frac{4}{5} \approx \frac{64}{81} = \frac{2^6}{3^4}.$$
