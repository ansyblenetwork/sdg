title: "Meantone temperament: Introducing the major third"
---

Recall from our [discussion of consonance]({{% post_url 2020-11-01-the-circle-of-fifths-why-there %}}) our list of small integer ratios:

$$\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{7}.$$

The next most consonant wavelength ratio of 1/5 essentially corresponds to a major third. As written, this interval is actually larger than two octaves; an actual major third corresponds to lowering the higher note of the interval by two octaves, for a 4 to 5 ratio.
