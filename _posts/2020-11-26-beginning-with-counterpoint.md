title: "Beginning with counterpoint"
---

I was fully intending to make this post about cadences, as an entry into harmony. But then I started reading about cadences, and got bored, perhaps due to past familiarity but also due to a lack of motive. Further, my current favorite resource, [Integrated Music Theory](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory20-21/05-counterpoint-embell-shapes/1-introcounterpoint.html) discusses counterpoint briefly before proceeding to harmony. I realized then that this is the sensible thing to do: From the perspective of sound and consonance, counterpoint is more basic; more pure and honest, than harmony. It is only my impressions about the order of music curriculum that suggests that harmony should be taught first.

### Contrapunctal motion

We introduce the following terminology:

Parallel motion:

<div id="score"></div>
<script>
makeInteractive("score", `
X:1
L:1/4
K:C
Q:1/2=60
V:1
C|D|E|F
V:2 class:bass
C|D|E|F
`);
</script>
