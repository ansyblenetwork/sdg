title: "Online music theory resources"
---

I'm about to leave the brief numerological realm of music theory, and proceed into more traditional music theory, so I was doing some research earlier. I found some decent-looking online resources that I thought to list here:

1. [Music Theory for the 21st-Century Classroom](http://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/MusicTheory.html): This looks to be a very thorough online music resource. It is organized like a textbook, interspersed with diagrams and some clips.
2. [Open Music Theory](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/) Similarly, a very thorough online music resource. Also organized like a textbook, with diagrams and clips.
3. [Integrated Musicianship](https://intmus.github.io/) A very clean and interactive site, also organized like a textbook. Probably the most modern resource listed here. It uses abcjs, for some interactive media. Also very thorough.
4. [About Music Theory](https://www.aboutmusictheory.com/c/uncategorized) A less organized site, in the style of a blog. Seems to have stopped posting as of 2012.
5. [The Tonal Centre](http://www.tonalcentre.org/index.html) An old site with some interesting remarks about scales and chords.
6. More to be added as I discover them.
