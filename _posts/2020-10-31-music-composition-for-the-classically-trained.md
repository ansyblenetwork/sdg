title: "Music composition for the classically trained pianist"

<div class="media">
  <p>Bach saw himself like Newton, not as the maker of a craft, but as a discoverer of the laws of the musical universe, of aesthetics...every piece he wrote, Bach, he signed as SDG, Soli Deo Gloria. You know, to the glory of God, alone. That’s what it means. To the glory of God alone. The key word is alone. Because it’s not to the glory of God and me, the composer. It’s to the glory of God and nobody else. Because the whole point was that he was out to glorify God by showing - by discovering the relation between nature and God. That was his only goal.</p>

The objective of this blog is to document my progress as I learn about music theory with an eye toward composition. I hope this resource may be of use to a specific demographic which I have a feeling is more common than its description would suggest: Longtime amateur musicians trained in performance but not theory, who are interested in composition and improvisation. I will only be posting about material that comes as a surprise to me - knowledge that presumably does not develop spontaneously from practice and performance (at least at an amateur level). For instance, I won't be reviewing performance notation. 

I do feel that this resource may fill a gap in the literature. My experience with online resources is that they tend to be split between very elementary and very mature, neither of which is appropriate for someone like me: A classically trained amateur pianist with essentially no theory education. 

<h3>About me</h3>

I took classical piano lessons for about ten years before college. I have played regularly "at home" for about another decade since then. The extent of my theory knowledge at the time of writing comes from studying (cramming) for an ABRSM grade 5 theory exam over ten years ago. I am a mathematician by profession.
