  <p>Bach saw himself like Newton, not as the maker of a craft, but as a discoverer of the laws of the musical universe, of aesthetics...every piece he wrote, Bach, he signed as SDG, Soli Deo Gloria. You know, to the glory of God, alone. That’s what it means. To the glory of God alone. The key word is alone. Because it’s not to the glory of God and me, the composer. It’s to the glory of God and nobody else. Because the whole point was that he was out to glorify God by showing - by discovering the relation between nature and God. That was his only goal.</p>

The objective of this site is not to glorify god, but it is to document my progress as I learn about music theory with an eye toward composition. I hope this resource may be of use to a specific demographic which I suspect is more common than its long description would suggest: Longtime amateur musicians trained in performance but not theory, interested in composition and improvisation. I will be posting about content that comes as a surprise to me - knowledge that presumably does not develop spontaneously from an amateur level of practice and performance. For instance, I won't be reviewing performance notation. 

<h3>About me</h3>

I took classical piano lessons for about ten years before college. I have played regularly "at home" for about another decade since then. The extent of my theory knowledge at the time of writing comes from studying (cramming) for an ABRSM theory exam over ten years ago. I am a mathematician by profession.
