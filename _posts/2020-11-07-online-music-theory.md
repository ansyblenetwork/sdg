title: "Online music theory resources"
---

I am about to leave the brief numerological realm of music theory, and proceed into more traditional music theory. I found some decent-looking online resources that I thought to list here.

The following are complete, textbook-like resources:

1. [Music Theory for the 21st-Century Classroom](http://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/MusicTheory.html): Interspersed with diagrams and some clips, this resource looks to be a bit more elementary than the others.
2. [Open Music Theory](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/): A very thorough online music resource with multiple authors. Probably the longest and most in-depth resource listed here.
3. [Integrated Musicianship](https://intmus.github.io/): A very clean and interactive site. Probably the most modern resource listed here. It uses abcjs for some interactive media.

The following are incomplete resources with some interesting information:

4. [About Music Theory](https://www.aboutmusictheory.com/c/uncategorized): A less organized site, in the style of a blog. Seems to have stopped posting as of 2012.
5. [The Tonal Centre](http://www.tonalcentre.org/index.html): An old site with some interesting remarks about scales and chords.
6. More to be added as I discover them.
