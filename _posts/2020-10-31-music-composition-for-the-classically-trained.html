title: "Music composition for the classically trained pianist"
---

I am a typical classically trained amateur pianist, with a mathematical background. I am interested in understanding music and musical composition. Online resources tend to be split between very elementary and very technical. I am starting this blog to track my progress, and I hope it may be of use for other amateur musicians trained in performance but not theory.
