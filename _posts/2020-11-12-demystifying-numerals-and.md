title: "Demystifying numerals and lead sheet notation"

Today we will try to resolve something that has always been a mystery to me: Sheet music for jazz and popular music. In particular, what is the meaning behind those numerals, spontaneously capitalized, peppered with superscripted 7's?

### Introduction

First, the basics: Numerals and lead sheet notation both refer to chords and triads. [Open music theory](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/lead-sheet-symbols/) comments on the philosophical difference:

<div class="media">
  Roman numerals are more theoretical and abstract, because they tell you the location of a chord relative to the key of the song. Lead sheet symbols, on the other hand, tell you exactly (absolutely) which notes are being played in this given chord, without reference to any outside system...In other words, the purpose of lead sheet symbols is to get performersâ€™ fingers to the right notes at the right time.

On the other hand, the absense of a theoretical connotation is sometimes useful when none is intended.

Note that there are notational variations in the literature, particularly among lead sheet symbols.
