#### What is it about Bach, that captures so well the human spirit?

I am not going to answer that question in this post. I am ill-equipped to answer that question, in any case. But I wanted to pose it, long in advance of any attempted answer, because I might never make such an attempt. And so the question must be posed, so that it is understood. Little slivers of what I say and do, are at all times small miserable attempts at providing slivers of an answer to that question.
