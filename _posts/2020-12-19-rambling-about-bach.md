#### What is it about Bach, that captures so well the human spirit?

I am not going to answer that question in this post. I am ill-equipped to answer that question, in any case. But I wanted to pose it, long in advance of any attempted answer, so that it is understood: Little slivers of what I say and write, are at all times small miserable attempts at providing slivers of an answer to that question.

When I try to think about words to describe Bach and his music, I usually come to some remarks Bernard Chazelle said in a podcast on [_On Being_](https://onbeing.org/programs/bernard-chazelle-discovering-the-cosmology-of-bach/#transcript):

<div class="media">
<p>What’s going on there? What’s happening? And, you know, I like to think, to simplify things, that as opposed to other composers, Bach targets the very young, the child, and people of a certain age, like me. And tries to leave out the middle. And what I mean by this is that there are all kinds of mental, psychological dispositions from the opera that he totally shunned. Envy. Greed. Lust. Jealousy. I mean, this is the bread and butter of the opera. He never went there. He had no interest in that. His music tries to express things like, awe. Grace. Thanks. Fear. Trepidation. Hope. All kinds of sentiments a child can have, and an older person can have, but none of this sexual nonsense in the middle.</p>

I like this description too much. It even sounds wiser in my mind when I recall it in paraphrase. Chazelle isn't a poet, but I like the way he thinks.

It is the athiest's interpretation of Bach, or perhaps the humanist's. It is an alternative to the easy understanding toward which the facts of history point, which is that Bach wrote music in description of god. No; Bach perhaps was religious, and perhaps his occupation demanded that in the literal sense, his music was a religious offering. But the music he wrote was at the same time a descriptive art, distilling what was not vile about humanity. Taking a sieve to the many moments by which humanity is preoccupied by acquisition - the envies, greeds, lusts, and jealousies that Chazelle aptly enumerated, and indeed, often of middle age - and seeing the honesty of what is left behind. And to conclude that what is left behind is good.

The interpretation is unfortunately almost certainly wrong. Any sensible interpretation, Occam's razor, the very title of this site, the signature SDG, Solid Deo gloria, indicates that any reading beyond Bach's religious obligation, is just the listener's imagination. But even the mathematician needs sometimes to indulge in trying to believe things that are not true.
